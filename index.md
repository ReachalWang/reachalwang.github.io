## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, advised by [Praneeth Chakravarthula](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~cpk/). Previously, I earned my Master degree in Electronic and Information Engineering in Shanghai Jiao Tong University (advised by [Prof. Yuan Qu](https://ssse.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/Info/413) and [Prof. Jiamiao Yang](https://sais.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/yangjiamiao.html)) and my Bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering from Tianjin University. 

My research lies at the intersection of physical optics, computer science, focusing on computational imaging, computational displays (holography), wavefront shaping and optical neural network.

Please feel free to email me [lianhy0@cs.unc.edu](mailto:lianhy0@cs.unc.edu) for any inquiries within my area.
